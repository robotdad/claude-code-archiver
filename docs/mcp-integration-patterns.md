# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration Patterns

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables Claude Code to integrate with external services and tools through standardized server connections. This document describes patterns observed in JSONL files related to MCP usage.

## MCP Server Identification

MCP-provided tools can be identified by their naming convention:
- All MCP tools start with prefix `mcp__`
- Example: `mcp__filesystem`, `mcp__browser`, etc.

## How to Identify MCP Usage in Your System

```bash
# Search for MCP tool usage in conversations
grep -h '"name":"mcp__' ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | \
  jq -r '.name' | sort | uniq -c

# Find MCP server references
grep -h 'mcp_' ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# Check for MCP configuration
ls ~/.claude/mcp* 2>/dev/null

# Look for MCP-related messages
grep -i "mcp" ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

## MCP Integration in JSONL

### Tool Invocation Pattern

MCP tools appear in assistant messages similar to built-in tools:

```json
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "id": "toolu_unique_id",
  "name": "mcp__servername_toolname",
  "input": {
    // Tool-specific parameters
  }
}
```

### Common MCP Server Types

Based on documentation and patterns:

1. **File System MCP Servers**
   - Enhanced file operations
   - Directory management
   - Advanced search capabilities

2. **Browser MCP Servers**
   - Web automation
   - Page interaction
   - Content extraction

3. **Database MCP Servers**
   - SQL operations
   - Data management
   - Query execution

4. **API MCP Servers**
   - REST API interactions
   - GraphQL support
   - Custom service integration

## MCP vs Built-in Tools

### When MCP Tools Are Preferred

The system may prefer MCP tools when:
- MCP server provides enhanced functionality
- Fewer restrictions than built-in tools
- Specialized capabilities needed
- Custom integrations required

### Tool Selection Priority

```
1. MCP-provided tools (if available and applicable)
2. Built-in Claude Code tools
3. Fallback to basic operations
```

## MCP Server Configuration

### Server Registration

MCP servers are registered with Claude Code and become available as tools. The configuration determines:
- Available methods/tools
- Parameter requirements
- Access permissions
- Server capabilities

### Dynamic Tool Discovery

MCP servers can expose tools dynamically:
- Tools discovered at connection time
- Capabilities queried from server
- Documentation provided by server

## Message Patterns with MCP

### MCP Tool Results

Results from MCP tools follow standard tool result format:

```json
{
  "type": "tool_result",
  "tool_use_id": "toolu_unique_id",
  "content": "MCP server response",
  "is_error": false
}
```

### MCP-Specific Fields

Messages involving MCP may include:
- Server identification
- Connection status
- Capability metadata
- Protocol version information

## Integration Points

### 1. Enhanced Web Operations

MCP browser servers provide:
- Full page automation
- JavaScript execution
- Cookie management
- Session handling

### 2. File System Extensions

MCP file servers offer:
- Advanced file operations
- Bulk processing
- Metadata handling
- Permission management

### 3. Custom Service Integration

MCP enables integration with:
- Company-specific tools
- Private APIs
- Local services
- Specialized databases

## Error Handling

### MCP Connection Errors

When MCP servers are unavailable:
- Fallback to built-in tools
- Error messages in tool results
- Graceful degradation

### Protocol Errors

MCP protocol issues appear as:
- Tool execution failures
- Malformed responses
- Version mismatches

## Performance Considerations

### MCP Overhead

- Network latency for remote servers
- Serialization/deserialization cost
- Connection establishment time

### Caching

MCP servers may implement:
- Response caching
- Connection pooling
- Result memoization

## Security Implications

### Access Control

MCP servers handle:
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Resource access limits
- Audit logging

### Data Privacy

Considerations for MCP usage:
- Data stays within MCP server bounds
- No automatic data sharing
- Server-specific privacy policies

## Evolution and Trends

### MCP Adoption

- Increasing number of MCP servers
- Community-contributed servers
- Enterprise integrations
- Specialized domain servers

### Protocol Development

- Standardization efforts
- Enhanced capabilities
- Performance improvements
- Security enhancements

## Best Practices

### For Analysis

Understanding MCP patterns:
1. Group by server type
2. Analyze usage frequency
3. Track error patterns
4. Monitor performance

## Conclusion

MCP integration represents an extensibility mechanism for Claude Code, allowing:
- Custom tool integration
- Enhanced capabilities
- Enterprise connectivity
- Specialized workflows
