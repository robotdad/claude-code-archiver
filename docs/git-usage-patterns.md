## Git Command Usage Patterns

### Commonly Observed Commands

| Command | Purpose | Common Variations |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `git status` | Check repository state | Often run before commits |
| `git diff` | Review changes | With `--cached` or specific files |
| `git log` | View history | `--oneline`, `-n 10`, `main..HEAD` |
| `git add` | Stage changes | `.`, `-A`, selective files |
| `git commit` | Create commits | Often uses HEREDOC for messages |
| `git push` | Push to remote | `-u origin branch` for new branches |
| `git checkout` | Switch branches | `-b` for new branches |
| `git branch` | List/create branches | `-a` to show all |

### Command Sequencing

Claude Code follows consistent command sequences:

#### Standard Development Flow
```bash
git status                    # Check current state
git diff                      # Review unstaged changes
git add .                     # Stage all changes
git diff --cached            # Review staged changes
git commit -m "message"      # Commit with message
git push                     # Push to remote
```

#### Pre-Commit Verification
```bash
git status                    # Verify clean state
git log --oneline -5         # Review recent commits
git diff main..HEAD          # Check branch changes
```

## Branch Management Patterns

### Branch Naming Conventions

| Pattern | Example | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `main` or `master` | `main` | Primary development branch |
| `issue-{N}-{description}` | `issue-9-implement-markdown` | Issue tracking branches |
| `feature/{name}` | `feature/dark-mode` | Feature development |
| `fix/{description}` | `fix/authentication-bug` | Bug fixes |
| `{prefix}-{description}` | Various prefixes | Project-specific conventions |

### Branch Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: `git checkout -b issue-123-description`
2. **Development**: Multiple commits with structured messages
3. **Push**: `git push -u origin issue-123-description`
4. **PR Creation**: Using GitHub CLI
5. **Merge**: Usually handled outside Claude Code

## Commit Message Structure

### Observed Pattern

Claude Code typically generates commits with this structure:

```
{Concise summary line}

{Optional bullet points for details:}
- First change detail
- Second change detail

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### HEREDOC Usage

Claude Code uses HEREDOC for multi-line commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Implement dark mode toggle feature

- Add theme context provider
- Update components for theme support
- Add toggle switch to settings

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

## Pull Request Patterns

### PR Creation with GitHub CLI

Standard PR creation pattern:

```bash
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Key change 1
- Key change 2

## Test Plan
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Related Issues
Closes #123

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
EOF
)"
```

### PR Body Structure

1. **Summary**: Bullet points of changes
2. **Test Plan**: Checklist format
3. **Related Issues**: Links to GitHub issues
4. **Claude Code Attribution**: Signature line

## Git Workflow Integration

### Development Session Patterns

#### New Feature Implementation
```
1. git checkout main
2. git pull origin main
3. git checkout -b feature/new-feature
4. [Development with multiple commits]
5. git push -u origin feature/new-feature
6. gh pr create
```

#### Bug Fix Workflow
```
1. git status (verify clean state)
2. git checkout -b fix/bug-description
3. [Fix implementation]
4. git add affected-files
5. git commit (structured message)
6. git push
```

### Commit Frequency

- **Simple tasks**: 1-2 commits per session
- **Feature development**: 3-5 commits with logical grouping
- **Complex refactoring**: 10+ commits with granular changes
- **SDK/Automated**: Single commit per attempt

## Git Worktree Usage

### Worktree Patterns

Worktrees enable parallel development on multiple issues:

```bash
# Create worktree for an issue or feature
git worktree add [path-to-worktree] [branch-name]

# Work in isolated environment
cd [path-to-worktree]
```

### Worktree Organization

Worktrees can be organized in various ways:
- Separate directory at same level as main repository
- Subdirectory within a dedicated workspace
- Project-specific organization structure
- Naming conventions vary by team/project

## Advanced Git Patterns

### Merge Conflict Resolution

```bash
# Check conflict status
git status

# Review conflicting changes
git diff

# Resolve by choosing version
git checkout --ours file.txt  # Keep current
git checkout --theirs file.txt # Take incoming
```

### Remote Repository Setup

```bash
# Initialize new repository
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Branch Synchronization

```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Check branch status
git status

# Pull with rebase
git pull --rebase origin main
```

## Correlation with Conversation Activities

### Typical Activity Patterns

| Conversation Activity | Common Git Operations |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Starting new feature | Branch creation, initial setup |
| Implementing changes | Progressive commits |
| Testing code | Status and diff checks |
| Completing task | Final commits, push, PR |
| Code review | Branch operations, diffs |
| Bug fixing | Targeted commits |

### Automation Capabilities

Claude Code can automate various git workflows:

1. **Commit message generation**: Structured formatting
2. **PR creation**: Using GitHub CLI
3. **Branch management**: Following conventions
4. **Status verification**: Checking state before operations

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Common Git Issues Handled

1. **Uncommitted Changes**
   - Detection: `git status` before operations
   - Resolution: Stage and commit or stash

2. **Branch Tracking**
   - Detection: Push failures
   - Resolution: `git push -u origin branch`

3. **Merge Conflicts**
   - Detection: Pull/merge failures
   - Resolution: Manual conflict resolution

4. **Hook Failures**
   - Detection: Pre-commit hook errors
   - Resolution: Fix issues and retry commit
