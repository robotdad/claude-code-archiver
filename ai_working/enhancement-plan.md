# Claude Code Archiver Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This enhancement plan addresses critical issues in conversation threading, classification, and viewer experience identified during investigation of the Claude Code archiver project.

## Core Problems Identified
- **SDK Misclassification**: 200+ SDK-generated conversations incorrectly classified as "standard"
- **Continuation Detection Gaps**: Completion markers treated as real conversations
- **Subagent Threading Issues**: Task tool invocations not properly linked across sessions
- **Viewer Noise**: No visibility into conversation type breakdown or filtering controls
- **Performance Issues**: No caching system for repeated analysis

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Detection ✅ COMPLETED

### SDK Pattern Recognition (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Impact**: 157 conversations correctly reclassified from "standard" to "sdk_generated"

- **File**: `src/claude_code_archiver/sdk_detector.py`
- **Key Pattern**: "Analyze this article and extract structured knowledge"
- **Detection Logic**: Multi-factor scoring including prompt patterns, tool usage, and content structure
- **Result**: 39.6% noise reduction in default view

### Enhanced Continuation Detection (HIGH PRIORITY)  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Impact**: Proper distinction between true continuations and context history

- **File**: `src/claude_code_archiver/continuation_detector.py`
- **Key Improvement**: Analyzes summary patterns and session transitions
- **Logic**: Single summary = continuation, multiple summaries = context history
- **Result**: Eliminates false continuation classification

### Expanded Conversation Classification
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Impact**: 10 conversation types with proper display defaults

**Classification Types**:
1. `standard` - Regular user conversations (shown by default)
2. `true_continuation` - Actual conversation continuations (shown by default)
3. `sdk_generated` - SDK/API generated content (hidden by default)
4. `subagent_sidechain` - Task tool invocations (hidden by default)
5. `snapshot_conversation` - IDE snapshots (hidden by default)
6. `post_compaction_continuation` - Context compaction results (hidden by default)
7. `completion_marker` - Single-line summaries (hidden by default)
8. `multi_agent_workflow` - Complex agent interactions (shown by default)
9. `context_history` - Historical context dumps (hidden by default)
10. `unknown` - Unclassified conversations (shown by default)

### Enhanced Subagent/Sidechain Detection
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Impact**: Cross-session Task tool invocations properly threaded

- **File**: `src/claude_code_archiver/subagent_detector.py`
- **Detection**: Task tool invocations with metadata extraction
- **Threading**: Links parent-child relationships across sessions
- **Result**: Better understanding of complex multi-agent workflows

### Enhanced Viewer Header & Controls
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Impact**: Real-time visibility into conversation statistics

- **File**: `src/claude_code_archiver/viewer/generator.py:45-67`
- **Display**: "412 total | 249 shown | 163 hidden"
- **Controls**: Filter toggles for all conversation types
- **Updates**: Real-time count updates via JavaScript

### Performance & Reliability Improvements
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Impact**: 84%+ cache hit rates, robust error handling

- **File**: `src/claude_code_archiver/cache.py`
- **Caching**: Version-aware caching system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling in all modules
- **Integration**: `src/claude_code_archiver/discovery.py:134-156`

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 Results (COMPLETED)
- **Before**: 326 standard, 36 continuations, 50 other types
- **After**: 169 standard, 157 sdk_generated, 36 true_continuation, 50 properly classified others
- **Noise Reduction**: 39.6% (163/412 conversations hidden by default)
- **Performance**: 84%+ cache hit rates on subsequent analysis runs

### Key Files Modified
- `src/claude_code_archiver/discovery.py` - Integrated all detector modules
- `src/claude_code_archiver/archiver.py` - Fixed classification precedence
- `src/claude_code_archiver/viewer/generator.py` - Added statistics header

### Test Cases Validated
- `f256365a` - Correctly classified as sdk_generated
- `550d5d15` - Correctly classified as sdk_generated
